# Api_security_scanner
##Python tool that performs API security vulnerability scanning using the pyattck library
##To run this code on Kali Linux, you need to have the pyattck library installed. You can install it using the following command:

pip install pyattck


Save the script to a file, such as api_security_scanner.py, and then run the script using the following command:


python3 api_security_scanner.py


##Replace http://api.example.com in the code with the URL of the API you want to scan for security vulnerabilities. The script will use the pyattck library to retrieve known vulnerabilities associated with the API and display them.

Please note that this tool relies on the ATT&CK framework and the information it provides regarding known vulnerabilities. It's important to keep the library and data up to date. Additionally, this is a simplified example, 
and API security scanning often requires a more comprehensive approach, including vulnerability assessment, penetration testing,
and other security testing techniques
